      <description>Designing with Capabilities - Scott Wlaschin A talk by Scott Wlaschin at DDD Europe, about designing systems by exposing capabilities restricting the consumer (a user or a piece of code) to only be able to consume the features available to him, instead of testing everywhere if the code has the permission to be executed. This looks like REST hypermedia applied to domain modelling, which seems appropriate to increase the affordance of the code we produce and consume.</description>

      <description>Hewitt, Meijer and Szyperski: The Actor Model (everything you wanted to know&amp;hellip;) A rare thing, a discussion between Carl Hewitt (the man who designed the actor model), Erik Meijer and Clemens Szyperski about the concepts behind the actor model. Way more valuable than the hordes of Akka tutorials.
The wikipedia page about the Actor Model is also very knowledgeable on this subject.
For further reading, the original paper can be found online: A Universal Modular Actor Formalism for Artificial Intelligence.</description>
